					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Jewelry Repair</h3>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Vincent Jewelers is a full service store, creating original design jewelry, making custom design jewelry, and stocking marketplace jewelry. I also do repairs and appraisals, offer advice and if so prompted, can blither mindless banter too.</p>
					<p>I stock a wide variety of stones and can replace lost or damaged stones</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Jewelry Restoration</h3>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Restoration of heirloom jewelry requires a careful eye and proper hand. Some material cannot be restored, and from the stone and other parts a custom-made piece or an original design is the desired substitute.  This cannot or will not be done by the staff in a chain jewelry store; they cannot afford to have a master artisan on staff to handle tasks such as that one.  You should only trust your precious heirlooms to a dedicated artisan [craftsman].</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Custom Jewelry</h3>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p> </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Jewelry Appraisals</h3>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Protect you investments and property by keeping your insurance and estate papers in order with appraisal and documentation of assets. I can provide images and written appraisals that will serve you, and provide off premises storage of vital information</p>
